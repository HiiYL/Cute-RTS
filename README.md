Cute RTS
=============

Setup
----
- Pull a fresh copy of the Cute-RTS repository. This repository has the base Nez repository as a submodule so to fully download everything you need add the `--recursive` parameter when cloning:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/HiiYL/Cute-RTS`

- open Nez/Nez.sln and build that first. This is required so that the NuGet packages are downloaded and the pipeline tool DLL is generated.
- now you can open Cute RTS.sln
